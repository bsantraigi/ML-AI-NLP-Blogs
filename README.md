## Variational AutoEncoder and its Variations

- [x] [Lil'Log - From Autoencoder to Beta-VAE](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/08/12/from-autoencoder-to-beta-vae.html): A very intuitive description of VAE for beginners and pros alike. Variants covered (at the time of addition) VAE, Beta-VAE, VQ-VAE, TD-VAE

## Language Models

- [x] [Controlling Text Generation with Plug and Play Language Models](https://eng.uber.com/pplm/): A fantastic work by researchers from Uber AI on how to control various attributes of generations from large scale Transformer Language Models like GPT-2. Their proposed model is really flexible in terms of what kind of controls can be used (word, bag-of-words, sentences, etc.) and seems generalizable enough.
